## 🧠 Overview
**S.T.E.E.R** is a reinforcement learning (RL) project focused on experimenting with custom agent training algorithms.  
It explores how intelligent agents learn from interaction and adapt their actions through reward-based feedback.

The repository contains multiple versions of the **S.T.E.E.R algorithm**, including variants that integrate **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** and other improvements.

---

## 🎯 Motivation
Reinforcement learning enables agents to make sequential decisions by learning from experience.  
This project was built to:

- Understand and implement RL algorithms from scratch.  
- Experiment with different optimization techniques like **PPO**.  
- Develop a learning system that can eventually control environments such as robotic simulations, cars, or game agents.  
- Serve as a foundation for larger AI-driven simulation systems.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Pure Python implementation of custom RL algorithms.  
- Versions and upgrades of the **S.T.E.E.R** framework:
  - `S.TEER.py` – Core base version.  
  - `STEER(PPO).py` – Enhanced with PPO for stable policy optimization.  
  - `v2_S.T.E.E.R.py` – Refined second generation version.  
- Modular structure for easy experimentation.  
- Designed for readability and educational clarity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.8+**
- Recommended libraries:  
numpy
torch
gym
matplotlib
(You can create a `requirements.txt` with these names.)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yashgoswami2007/S.T.E.E.R_reinforcement_learning.git
cd S.T.E.E.R_reinforcement_learning
pip install -r requirements.txt

python S.TEER.py
# or
python "STEER(PPO).py"
# or
python "v2_S.T.E.E.R.py"
🧩 Usage

Modify parameters such as learning rate, discount factor, or reward scaling directly in the script.

Integrate with environments from OpenAI Gym or a custom simulator.

Observe how the agent’s reward curve changes with each version.

Use the PPO version for more stable and efficient learning.

📊 Experiments & Results

You can document your findings here (example layout):

Version	Environment	Avg Reward	Notes
v1 (Base)	CartPole-v1	120	Unstable training
v2 (PPO)	CartPole-v1	500	Achieved stability and full episode success
